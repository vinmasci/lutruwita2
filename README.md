## RULES FOR CLAUDE AI
Before suggesting an update to a file, always check it on GITHUB first
When making multiple changes to one file, its probably easier just to give me the whole file
If you dont give me the full file, give me the code in before and after so I can easily copy and paste
Dont try to edit my code, it wont work

## ACTIVE GOAL
Surface Detection System - Implementation Status
Current Implementation

Custom vector tileset created in MapTiler containing Australia's road network with surface data
Dataset includes explicit surface information for most roads (e.g., "paved", "unpaved", "asphalt", etc.)
Successfully loading and displaying surface data at zoom level 13
Surface information is visually confirmed in MapTiler Cloud preview
Layer rendering using surface type matching:
typescriptCopy'line-color': [
  'match',
  ['get', 'surface'],
  ['asphalt', 'paved', 'concrete'], '#4A90E2',
  ['unpaved', 'gravel', 'dirt'], '#D35400',
  '#888888'
]


Surface Detection Process

Upload GPX route
Process points in batches
For each point:

Ensure zoom level 13 (optimal for surface data)
Query features at point location
Extract surface information directly from feature properties
If surface data found, classify as paved/unpaved
If no surface data, use previous point's classification



Data Structure Found
From successful feature queries, we're getting surface data like:
typescriptCopy{
  surface: "paved",
  highway: "tertiary",
  name: "Example Road",
  // other properties...
}
Current Issue

Feature querying works intermittently
When it works, surface data is correctly accessed
Need to ensure consistent feature querying before surface detection

Next Debug Steps

Verify source data loading state
Monitor source/feature availability
Test feature querying with different zoom levels
Implement graceful fallback for missing data:

Use previous point's surface type
Continue processing instead of stopping
Allow manual correction later



Proposed Solution

Keep zoom level at 13 throughout process
Query features using source layer and surface property
Maintain previous successful surface type as fallback
Continue processing even if individual points fail
Allow batch reprocessing of failed sections

Technical Implementation
typescriptCopy// Query features with surface data
const features = map.current.queryRenderedFeatures(
  [[point.lon, point.lat]], 
  { layers: ['custom-roads'] }
);

// Extract surface information
if (features.length > 0) {
  const surface = features[0].properties?.surface?.toLowerCase();
  if (surface) {
    // Use direct surface property
    surfaceType = ['paved', 'asphalt', 'concrete'].includes(surface) 
      ? 'paved' 
      : 'unpaved';
  }
}

### My Original Vision
- I want to make a web app that is easily translatable to mobile.. 
- I would like to use react + react native so that I have the option to scale in the future
- I would like to use material ui for the bottom navigation which will be scrollable tabs with icons.. give me 6 place holder tabs
- I dont want a top navbar, I want to use Shadcn/UI Sidebar..
- It is to be a web app that creates beautiful maps for people to engage with, whether it be cycling or hiking etc.
- There will need to be a floating map tools panel for search, current location, zoom and pivot
- One page will be to create a map (so like an admin page almost), the user will then be able to embed that map and other people will be able to interact with it
- On the admin page, the user will be able to either upload a gpx file or draw a route onto the map (The gpx file or the drawn route will take into account the surface type of the road, track or path it is on) and be a solid line for paved or a dashed line for unpaved or unknown
- I would like the map to be mapbox outdoor to begin with but give the option of light, dark, streets, satellite, hybrid and 3d (the user will also be able to select this option
- There will be a comment system for the admin as well as the users where they can create a point of interest on the map and choose an icon to associate with it.. I would like to see it as sort of like a speech box or something with an icon in it that they choose (it might be for a town, supermarket, petrol station, bike shop, camping site, accommodation, tourist poi, cafe or restaurant, swimming spot, water point, river crossing, warning, train station, bus stop, ferry, hazard etc.)
- On the sidebar, I would like there to be three toggles, when one is enables, the other two are still present but you wont be able to interact with them 1. The route toggle (this will be draw mode for admin, or for the user they will be able to see the full route of gpx), the admin will be able to add many routes to one map, so there may be more than one. In admin, there should be an option to add another, then another etc. There should be an elevation profile as they draw (sticky at the bottom of the screen above the tabs). The elevation profile should also show the surface type and a coloured by the grade. 0 - 3% green, 3 - 6% yellow, 6 - 9% orange, 9 - 12% red, 12 - 15% maroon, 15% + black. The route should always be shown on the page, but really transparent when the surface type is toggled. The route line should be cyan. 2. Gradient Toggle - this will turn the route into a gradient, showing the steepness of the course. This is only required for the user.3. Surface Toggle - this will allow the admin to go into draw mode again and draw segments over roads with a rating of 0 - 6 (which will essentially be a guide for the surface type of the road). 0 - green, 1 - green dashed yellow, 2 - yellow, 3 - yellow dashed red, 4 - red, 5 red dashed moroon, 6 maroon. Also purple for bike paths and purple dashed for gravel bike paths. I would like the segment line to be wide and fairly transparent. It should always be present on the page, but more transparent when the gradient or route are toggled.

# Map Save/Load System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a system to save, load, and share map states, including routes, photos, and surface data.

## Data Structure

### SavedMap Interface
```typescript
interface SavedMap {
    _id?: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    createdBy: string;
    isPublic: boolean;
    gpxData: string;
    routeData: {
        coordinates: Array<{
            lat: number;
            lon: number;
            surface: 'paved' | 'unpaved';
        }>;
    };
    photoIds: string[];
    viewState: {
        center: [number, number];
        zoom: number;
        pitch?: number;
        bearing?: number;
    };
}
```

   - POST /api/maps (create)
   - GET /api/maps/:id (read)
   - PATCH /api/maps/:id (update)
   - GET /api/maps (list)
2. Implement authentication middleware
3. Add validation middleware
4. Set up error handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Components
1. Create SaveMapModal component

   - Store GPX data
   - Save view state
2. Implement load functionality:
   - Restore map view
   - Load route data
   - Fetch associated photos
   - Apply surface types

### Phase 5: Sharing System
