### My Original Vision
- I want to make a web app that is easily translatable to mobile.. 
- I would like to use react + react native so that I have the option to scale in the future
- I would like to use material ui for the bottom navigation which will be scrollable tabs with icons.. give me 6 place holder tabs
- I dont want a top navbar, I want to use Shadcn/UI Sidebar..
- It is to be a web app that creates beautiful maps for people to engage with, whether it be cycling or hiking etc.
- There will need to be a floating map tools panel for search, current location, zoom and pivot
- One page will be to create a map (so like an admin page almost), the user will then be able to embed that map and other people will be able to interact with it
- On the admin page, the user will be able to either upload a gpx file or draw a route onto the map (The gpx file or the drawn route will take into account the surface type of the road, track or path it is on) and be a solid line for paved or a dashed line for unpaved or unknown
- I would like the map to be mapbox outdoor to begin with but give the option of light, dark, streets, satellite, hybrid and 3d (the user will also be able to select this option
- There will be a comment system for the admin as well as the users where they can create a point of interest on the map and choose an icon to associate with it.. I would like to see it as sort of like a speech box or something with an icon in it that they choose (it might be for a town, supermarket, petrol station, bike shop, camping site, accommodation, tourist poi, cafe or restaurant, swimming spot, water point, river crossing, warning, train station, bus stop, ferry, hazard etc.)
- On the sidebar, I would like there to be three toggles, when one is enables, the other two are still present but you wont be able to interact with them 1. The route toggle (this will be draw mode for admin, or for the user they will be able to see the full route of gpx), the admin will be able to add many routes to one map, so there may be more than one. In admin, there should be an option to add another, then another etc. There should be an elevation profile as they draw (sticky at the bottom of the screen above the tabs). The elevation profile should also show the surface type and a coloured by the grade. 0 - 3% green, 3 - 6% yellow, 6 - 9% orange, 9 - 12% red, 12 - 15% maroon, 15% + black. The route should always be shown on the page, but really transparent when the surface type is toggled. The route line should be cyan. 2. Gradient Toggle - this will turn the route into a gradient, showing the steepness of the course. This is only required for the user.3. Surface Toggle - this will allow the admin to go into draw mode again and draw segments over roads with a rating of 0 - 6 (which will essentially be a guide for the surface type of the road). 0 - green, 1 - green dashed yellow, 2 - yellow, 3 - yellow dashed red, 4 - red, 5 red dashed moroon, 6 maroon. Also purple for bike paths and purple dashed for gravel bike paths. I would like the segment line to be wide and fairly transparent. It should always be present on the page, but more transparent when the gradient or route are toggled.
