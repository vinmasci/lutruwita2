## THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT! I AM SO CLOSE, I TRIED TO UPDATE BUT THERE WAS A SYNTAX ERROR, HELP ME IMPLEMENT THIS:

[Log] [assignSurfacesViaNearest] Processing point #2200, coords=(-41.16352, 147.7631) (map-container.tsx, line 326)EditNo! This shows exactly what's wrong. Look at these coordinates:
Point we're checking: [-41.16984, 147.74979]
Roads we're getting: All around [147.47, -41.30]
And then after we implement the bounding box query:
Copy[Log] [assignSurfacesViaNearest] Querying around point: – {bbox: [147.7581, -41.16852, 147.7681, ...], found: 81, location: [-41.16352, 147.7631]}
[Log] [assignSurfacesViaNearest] Found roads: – {count: 81, surfaces: Array}
See the difference? When we query with a bounding box around the actual point:

First query: 15 roads (from wrong location)
Second query with bbox: 81 roads (from correct location)

This confirms our diagnosis - we were getting cached road data from the wrong location. The new bounding box query is finding the actual roads near the point (81 of them).
Would you like me to help implement the fix for the entire processing loop to ensure we're always getting the right roads for each point? CopyRetryJyes pleaseEditLet me provide the before/after for the core processing section. Looking at your code, we need to modify the point processing loop in assignSurfacesViaNearest.
BEFORE:
typescriptCopyconst results: Point[] = [];
for (let i = 0; i < coords.length; i++) {
    // Every 100 points, move the viewport
    if (i % 100 === 0) {
        const pt = coords[i];
        await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
            let attempts = 0;
            const maxAttempts = 10;
            
            const checkTiles = () => {
                const features = map.current?.querySourceFeatures('australia-roads', {
                    sourceLayer: 'lutruwita'
                });
                
                if (features && features.length > 0) {
                    console.log('[assignSurfacesViaNearest] Features found after move:', {
                        count: features.length,
                        location: [pt.lat, pt.lon]
                    });
                    resolve();
                    return;
                }
                
                attempts++;
                if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
                    console.warn('[assignSurfacesViaNearest] Max attempts reached at location:', [pt.lat, pt.lon]);
                    resolve();
                    return;
                }
                
                setTimeout(checkTiles, 300);
            };
            
            // Move the map
            map.current?.jumpTo({
                center: [pt.lon, pt.lat],
                zoom: 13
            });
            
            // Start checking
            checkTiles();
        });
    }
AFTER:
typescriptCopyconst results: Point[] = [];
for (let i = 0; i < coords.length; i++) {
    const pt = coords[i];
    
    // For each point, ensure we have the right roads loaded
    if (i % 10 === 0) { // Check more frequently - every 10 points
        await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
            let attempts = 0;
            const maxAttempts = 10;
            
            const checkTiles = () => {
                // Create bounding box around current point
                const bbox = [
                    pt.lon - 0.005, // ~500m west
                    pt.lat - 0.005, // ~500m south
                    pt.lon + 0.005, // ~500m east
                    pt.lat + 0.005  // ~500m north
                ];
                
                // Move map to this area
                map.current?.fitBounds(bbox, {
                    padding: 50,
                    duration: 0,
                    maxZoom: 13,
                    minZoom: 13
                });

                // Query roads in this area
                const features = map.current?.queryRenderedFeatures(undefined, {
                    layers: ['custom-roads']
                });
                
                if (features && features.length > 0) {
                    console.log('[assignSurfacesViaNearest] Point area scan:', {
                        point: [pt.lat, pt.lon],
                        foundRoads: features.length,
                        surfaces: features.map(f => f.properties.surface).filter(Boolean)
                    });
                    
                    // Update cached roads for this area
                    cachedRoadsRef.current = turf.featureCollection(
                        features.map(f => turf.feature(f.geometry, f.properties))
                    );
                    resolve();
                    return;
                }
                
                attempts++;
                if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
                    console.warn('[assignSurfacesViaNearest] No roads found near:', [pt.lat, pt.lon]);
                    resolve();
                    return;
                }
                
                setTimeout(checkTiles, 300);
            };
            
            checkTiles();
        });
    }
The key changes are:

Checking more frequently (every 10 points instead of 100)
Using a bounding box around each point
Using queryRenderedFeatures for actual visible roads
Better logging of what roads we find
Always keeping our cached roads up to date with the current area

Would you like me to help implement this change?


### BELOW IS WHAT LED US HERE

Surface Detection System Analysis
Current Implementation Status
What's Working

Custom Vector Tileset

Successfully created in MapTiler containing road surface data
URL: tiles/5dd3666f-1ce4-4df6-9146-eda62a200bcb
Source layer name: 'lutruwita'
Zoom levels: 12-14 (expanded from initial 13-only)


Data Structure

Confirmed surface types in data:

Paved types: ['paved', 'asphalt', 'concrete', 'compacted']
Unpaved types: ['unpaved', 'gravel']


Features are successfully loaded (seen in logs with 2499+ features)


Map Configuration

Source configuration working correctly
Layer style correctly maps surface types to colors
Zoom level constraints implemented



Current Issues

Timing Problems
typescriptCopy// Current pattern we see:
{sourceId: "australia-roads", sourceLoaded: true, dataType: "source", tile: undefined}
// Followed by multiple:
{sourceId: "australia-roads", sourceLoaded: false, dataType: "source", tile: yt}

Initial "loaded" state is false positive (no actual tile data)
Multiple loading states causing premature queries


Feature Query Issues

Initial queries return 0 features even when data is present
Subsequent queries work correctly (2499+ features)
Indicates timing issue with data availability


Zoom Level Handling

Current zoom level check might complete before tiles are fully loaded
No verification of data availability at correct zoom



Solutions Attempted

Basic Source Loading Check
typescriptCopyif (map.current?.isSourceLoaded('australia-roads'))

❌ Failed: Reports true too early


Tile Loading Check
typescriptCopyif (map.current?.areTilesLoaded())

❌ Failed: Doesn't guarantee feature data availability


Combined Loading Checks
typescriptCopyif (tilesLoaded && sourceLoaded && zoomCorrect)

⚠️ Partial Success: Better but still timing issues



Recommendations

Enhanced Load Verification
typescriptCopyconst verifyDataAvailability = () => {
  const features = map.querySourceFeatures('australia-roads', {
    sourceLayer: 'lutruwita'
  });
  return features.length > 0;
};

Implement Progressive Loading

Split route into smaller segments
Process each segment after confirming data availability
Cache results to avoid requerying same areas


Consider Turf.js Integration
typescriptCopy// Future enhancement if needed
const nearestRoad = turf.nearestPoint(
  turf.point([point.lon, point.lat]),
  turf.featureCollection(roadFeatures)
);


Next Steps

Immediate Fixes

Implement feature count verification before proceeding
Add exponential backoff for retry attempts
Improve error handling for missing data


Medium Term

Add data caching for processed segments
Implement batch processing for better performance
Add visual feedback for processing status


Long Term

Consider pre-processing GPX files server-side
Implement offline capability for processed routes
Add surface type confidence scoring



Code Patterns to Implement
typescriptCopyawait new Promise<void>(resolve => {
  const checkDataReady = () => {
    const features = map.current.querySourceFeatures('australia-roads', {
      sourceLayer: 'lutruwita'
    });
    
    if (features.length > 0) {
      resolve();
    } else {
      setTimeout(checkDataReady, 100);
    }
  };
  
  checkDataReady();
});
This pattern ensures:

Actual data availability
Proper error handling
Clear logging for debugging

Monitoring Recommendations

Add Telemetry

Track time to first feature
Monitor query success rates
Log feature counts per tile


Performance Metrics

Time per point processing
Memory usage during large route processing
Cache hit rates



Testing Strategy

Unit Tests

Surface type classification
Feature detection logic
Loading state management


Integration Tests

GPX file processing
Tile loading sequences
Surface detection accuracy


Performance Tests

Large route processing
Memory usage optimization
Cache effectiveness
