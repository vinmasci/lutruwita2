## Where we are at:
The logs are showing us that IMMEDIATELY after we parse the GPX points, the map is querying data at zoom level 8 because our custom-roads layer is defined to handle zoom levels 12-14, but the code is trying to access it at zoom level 8!
The fix is simple - we need to make sure we're at zoom 13 BEFORE we do any data queries or route drawing.

### BELOW IS WHAT LED US HERE

Surface Detection System Analysis
Current Implementation Status
What's Working

Custom Vector Tileset

Successfully created in MapTiler containing road surface data
URL: tiles/5dd3666f-1ce4-4df6-9146-eda62a200bcb
Source layer name: 'lutruwita'
Zoom levels: 12-14 (expanded from initial 13-only)


Data Structure

Confirmed surface types in data:

Paved types: ['paved', 'asphalt', 'concrete', 'compacted']
Unpaved types: ['unpaved', 'gravel']


Features are successfully loaded (seen in logs with 2499+ features)


Map Configuration

Source configuration working correctly
Layer style correctly maps surface types to colors
Zoom level constraints implemented



Current Issues

Timing Problems
typescriptCopy// Current pattern we see:
{sourceId: "australia-roads", sourceLoaded: true, dataType: "source", tile: undefined}
// Followed by multiple:
{sourceId: "australia-roads", sourceLoaded: false, dataType: "source", tile: yt}

Initial "loaded" state is false positive (no actual tile data)
Multiple loading states causing premature queries


Feature Query Issues

Initial queries return 0 features even when data is present
Subsequent queries work correctly (2499+ features)
Indicates timing issue with data availability


Zoom Level Handling

Current zoom level check might complete before tiles are fully loaded
No verification of data availability at correct zoom



Solutions Attempted

Basic Source Loading Check
typescriptCopyif (map.current?.isSourceLoaded('australia-roads'))

❌ Failed: Reports true too early


Tile Loading Check
typescriptCopyif (map.current?.areTilesLoaded())

❌ Failed: Doesn't guarantee feature data availability


Combined Loading Checks
typescriptCopyif (tilesLoaded && sourceLoaded && zoomCorrect)

⚠️ Partial Success: Better but still timing issues



Recommendations

Enhanced Load Verification
typescriptCopyconst verifyDataAvailability = () => {
  const features = map.querySourceFeatures('australia-roads', {
    sourceLayer: 'lutruwita'
  });
  return features.length > 0;
};

Implement Progressive Loading

Split route into smaller segments
Process each segment after confirming data availability
Cache results to avoid requerying same areas


Consider Turf.js Integration
typescriptCopy// Future enhancement if needed
const nearestRoad = turf.nearestPoint(
  turf.point([point.lon, point.lat]),
  turf.featureCollection(roadFeatures)
);


Next Steps

Immediate Fixes

Implement feature count verification before proceeding
Add exponential backoff for retry attempts
Improve error handling for missing data


Medium Term

Add data caching for processed segments
Implement batch processing for better performance
Add visual feedback for processing status


Long Term

Consider pre-processing GPX files server-side
Implement offline capability for processed routes
Add surface type confidence scoring



Code Patterns to Implement
typescriptCopyawait new Promise<void>(resolve => {
  const checkDataReady = () => {
    const features = map.current.querySourceFeatures('australia-roads', {
      sourceLayer: 'lutruwita'
    });
    
    if (features.length > 0) {
      resolve();
    } else {
      setTimeout(checkDataReady, 100);
    }
  };
  
  checkDataReady();
});
This pattern ensures:

Actual data availability
Proper error handling
Clear logging for debugging

Monitoring Recommendations

Add Telemetry

Track time to first feature
Monitor query success rates
Log feature counts per tile


Performance Metrics

Time per point processing
Memory usage during large route processing
Cache hit rates



Testing Strategy

Unit Tests
