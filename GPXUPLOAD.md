# Surface Detection Debug Analysis

## Initial Problem
- Surface detection was returning 0 length intersections
- Getting 27 road matches but all with 0 length
- Route points all being marked as 'unknown' surface

## What We Ruled Out
* SRID/Projection issues - confirmed roads and route were both in SRID 4326
* Data availability - confirmed roads exist in database with correct surfaces
* Query structure - the base query was finding the correct roads
* Connection issues - consistently getting responses from database
* Invalid geometries - ST_Intersects was working, geometries valid

## What We Fixed
1. **Point Intersection Issue**
   - Found route was only touching roads at points (0 length)
   - Added ST_Snap to properly align route with roads
   - Result: Now getting proper intersection lengths (e.g., 3.1km, 2.7km segments)

2. **Length Calculations**
   - Previous: All intersections returning 0 length
   - Now: Getting accurate lengths for each segment
   - Example from logs:
     ```
     {
       surface: "unpaved", 
       length: 3138.909983196663, 
       percentage: 18.65214189128866
     }
     ```

3. **Client-Side Processing**
   - Previous: All points getting same surface type
   - Added logic to map points to segments based on position
   - Getting proper segmentation of route

## Current Status
1. **What's Working**
   - Database query returning correct segments
   - Length calculations accurate
   - Surface types being detected
   - Proper segmentation of route

2. **Current Issue**
   - Surface types are reversed in presentation
   - 'paved' roads showing as 'unpaved' and vice versa
   - Data is correct in database but presentation is inverted

## Required Fix
Need to flip surface type either:
1. In SQL query using CASE statement
2. Or in client-side code during processing

All core functionality is now working correctly, just needs surface type inversion fixed for correct presentation.

## Database Confirmation
Surface classifications in database are correct:
```sql
original_surface | standardized_surface
-----------------|--------------------
asphalt          | asphalt
paved            | paved
unpaved          | unpaved
```

## Next Steps
1. Decide whether to fix surface inversion at:
   - Database query level
   - Or client-side processing level
2. Implement fix
3. Test with different route types to verify fix maintains accurate surface detection
# GPX Upload and Processing Documentation

## Overview
We are migrating the GPX file processing from client-side to server-side using Digital Ocean. This will improve performance, reduce client workload, and enable more sophisticated processing capabilities. The main goals are:
1. Move file upload and processing to Digital Ocean
2. Implement server-side surface detection using PostGIS
3. Add efficient caching and optimization
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Completed Tasks

### Client-Side Structure
- ✅ Separated GPX processing logic from MapContainer
- ✅ Created GPX processing hook (useGpxProcessing)
- ✅ Created route rendering hook (useRouteRendering)
- ✅ Added cleanup for photo markers and event listeners
- ✅ Moved environment variables to .env.local
- ✅ Added proper error handling in client components
- ✅ Added progress indicators for processing
- ✅ Improved route data management

### API Structure
- ✅ Defined API endpoints
- ✅ Created GPX service class
- ✅ Added PhotoService for photo handling
- ✅ Created basic type definitions

1. Setting up the Node.js runtime environment
2. Configuring deployment settings
3. Setting up production environment variables

### 3. API Endpoints to Implement
```typescript
POST /api/gpx/upload
- Handle file upload to DO Spaces
- Initial validation
- Return upload ID

POST /api/gpx/process/:id
- Parse GPX file
- Detect surface types
- Process elevation data
- Return processing status

GET /api/gpx/status/:id
- Return current processing status
- Include progress information

GET /api/gpx/route/:id

## Notes
- The server needs to handle large GPX files efficiently
- Surface detection should use PostGIS spatial queries
- All file operations should be asynchronous
- Processing should be queued for large files
- Add proper logging for debugging
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed operations
- Cache commonly accessed routes
- Add monitoring for server health
