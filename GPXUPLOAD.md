# OpenStreetMap Import Status

## Current Goal
We are trying to import Australian OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into PostGIS to enable fast, server-side surface detection for routes. This will replace the current client-side surface detection that uses MapTiler.

## What's Been Done
1. Upgraded Digital Ocean database from 10GB to 60GB to accommodate Australian OSM data
2. Downloaded australia-latest.osm.pbf file
3. Installed osm2pgsql (version 2.0.1) locally for importing data
4. Confirmed PostGIS and hstore extensions are installed in the database

## Current Issue
We're encountering problems with the database extensions setup when trying to run osm2pgsql:

1. The command we're trying to run:
```bash
osm2pgsql -d "postgresql://doadmin:[password]@db-postgresql-syd1-03661-do-user-18256196-0.m.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/defaultdb?sslmode=require" \
  --hstore \
  --create \
  --slim \
  --extra-attributes \
  --prefix osm \
  ~/Desktop/OSM\ DATA/australia-latest.osm.pbf
```

2. Error received:
```
ERROR: Database error: ERROR: type "hstore" does not exist
LINE 1: ...xt,"width" text,"wood" text,"z_order" int4,"tags" hstore,way...
```

3. Investigation shows:
- hstore extension exists in the public schema
- PostGIS extension is installed
- We're unable to recreate these extensions due to permission issues or existing installations

## Next Steps Required
1. Resolve extension configuration issues:
   - Need to properly configure hstore extension accessibility
   - Ensure extensions are in the correct schema
   - Verify permissions for the database user

2. Once resolved:
   - Import the OSM data
   - Create appropriate indexes
   - Set up surface detection queries

## Impact on Project
This is a critical step for improving route surface detection because:
- It will make surface detection much faster
- Reduce client-side processing
- Provide more accurate surface data
- Enable better scalability

## Potential Solutions to Explore
1. Work with Digital Ocean support to properly configure extensions
2. Use a different import approach that doesn't require hstore
3. Create a new database with clean extension setup
4. Modify osm2pgsql import flags to work with existing setup










# GPX Upload and Processing Documentation

## Overview
We are migrating the GPX file processing from client-side to server-side using Digital Ocean. This will improve performance, reduce client workload, and enable more sophisticated processing capabilities. The main goals are:
1. Move file upload and processing to Digital Ocean
2. Implement server-side surface detection using PostGIS
3. Add efficient caching and optimization
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Completed Tasks

### Client-Side Structure
- ✅ Separated GPX processing logic from MapContainer
- ✅ Created GPX processing hook (useGpxProcessing)
- ✅ Created route rendering hook (useRouteRendering)
- ✅ Added cleanup for photo markers and event listeners
- ✅ Moved environment variables to .env.local
- ✅ Added proper error handling in client components
- ✅ Added progress indicators for processing
- ✅ Improved route data management

### API Structure
- ✅ Defined API endpoints
- ✅ Created GPX service class
- ✅ Added PhotoService for photo handling
- ✅ Created basic type definitions

### NEXT STEPS:
Configure App Platform for the backend service, starting with the Node.js environment setup. This will involve:
1. Setting up the Node.js runtime environment
2. Configuring deployment settings
3. Setting up production environment variables

### 3. API Endpoints to Implement
```typescript
POST /api/gpx/upload
- Handle file upload to DO Spaces
- Initial validation
- Return upload ID

POST /api/gpx/process/:id
- Parse GPX file
- Detect surface types
- Process elevation data
- Return processing status

GET /api/gpx/status/:id
- Return current processing status
- Include progress information

GET /api/gpx/route/:id
- Return processed route data
- Include surface information

POST /api/photos/near-points
- Find photos near route points
- Return photo metadata
```

### 4. Server-Side Processing
- [ ] Implement GPX parsing service
- [ ] Add surface detection using PostGIS
- [ ] Create route optimization service
- [ ] Add elevation profile generation
- [ ] Implement photo proximity detection
- [ ] Add processing queue system

## Notes
- The server needs to handle large GPX files efficiently
- Surface detection should use PostGIS spatial queries
- All file operations should be asynchronous
- Processing should be queued for large files
- Add proper logging for debugging
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed operations
- Cache commonly accessed routes
- Add monitoring for server health
