# Surface Detection Implementation Status

## Current State

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Road network data successfully imported into PostgreSQL
   - Table structure:
     - `road_network` table: MULTILINESTRING geometries with SRID 4326
     - `surface_classifications` table: Links road surfaces to standardized types
   - Sample query proves database has working surface data and intersections

2. **Working Test Query**
```sql
WITH sample_route AS (
    SELECT ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(151.0979059 -33.9131881, 151.0990232 -33.9127386)', 4326) as geom
)
SELECT 
    rn.id,
    COALESCE(sc.standardized_surface, 'unknown') as surface_type,
    ST_Length(ST_Intersection(rn.geometry, sr.geom)::geography) as intersection_length,
    ST_Length(sr.geom::geography) as total_route_length,
    (ST_Length(ST_Intersection(rn.geometry, sr.geom)::geography) / ST_Length(sr.geom::geography) * 100) as percentage
FROM sample_route sr
JOIN road_network rn ON ST_Intersects(rn.geometry, sr.geom)
LEFT JOIN surface_classifications sc ON rn.surface = sc.original_surface
ORDER BY intersection_length DESC;
```

3. **Current Issues**
   - Surface types are being detected correctly
   - Intersection lengths are all returning 0
   - Frontend receives empty array when route has 2428 points
   - Working sample query with 2 points returns proper intersection lengths

## Key Findings

1. **Database Configuration**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT GeometryType(geometry) FROM road_network;
   -- Returns: MULTILINESTRING

   SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(geometry) FROM road_network;
   -- Returns: 4326
   ```

2. **Surface Detection Results**
   - Sample route works: Gets intersection lengths and percentages
   - Full route fails: Returns all zero lengths despite correct surface types
   - Difference may be related to route complexity (2 points vs 2428 points)

## Required Fixes

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Need to handle large LineStrings (2428 points)
   - May need to segment route for better processing
   - Consider adding spatial index for performance
   - Validate geometry before intersection calculations

2. **Server Changes**
   - Add debugging output for geometry validation
   - Log intermediate steps in intersection calculations
   - Add error handling for invalid geometries

3. **Frontend Changes**
   - Update surface-detection.ts to handle empty results better
   - Add fallback surface types when no intersections found
   - Improve error handling for failed detection

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Verify route geometry is valid with ST_IsValid()
   - Test intersection calculation with simplified route
   - Add logging to track where data is lost

2. **Further Investigation Needed**
   - Performance impact of large routes
   - Alternative methods for intersection calculation
   - Potential geometry simplification strategies

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Add caching for common routes
   - Implement route simplification
   - Consider batch processing for large routes

## Sample Queries for Debugging

1. **Geometry Validation**
```sql
SELECT ST_IsValid(geometry), COUNT(*) 
FROM road_network 
GROUP BY ST_IsValid(geometry);
```

2. **Intersection Testing**
```sql
-- For testing with simplified route
WITH route AS (
  SELECT ST_Simplify(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON($1), 0.0001) as geom
)
```

3. **Performance Analysis**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT ST_Intersects(rn.geometry, route.geom)
FROM route, road_network rn
WHERE ST_DWithin(rn.geometry::geography, route.geom::geography, 10);
```


# GPX Upload and Processing Documentation

## Overview
We are migrating the GPX file processing from client-side to server-side using Digital Ocean. This will improve performance, reduce client workload, and enable more sophisticated processing capabilities. The main goals are:
1. Move file upload and processing to Digital Ocean
2. Implement server-side surface detection using PostGIS
3. Add efficient caching and optimization
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Completed Tasks

### Client-Side Structure
- ✅ Separated GPX processing logic from MapContainer

- ✅ Added proper error handling in client components
- ✅ Added progress indicators for processing
- ✅ Improved route data management

### API Structure
