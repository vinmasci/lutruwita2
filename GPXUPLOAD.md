### CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (SLOW) 

Let me check your repository for the GPX file handling code.

After reviewing your code, here's how the GPX file loading process works in your application:

1. Initial Upload:
- When a user selects a GPX file, the `GpxUploader` component handles the file selection using a hidden input element
- The component first validates that the file is a .gpx file
- It then uses FileReader to read the file content as text

2. GPX Processing (`handleGpxUpload` in MapContainer):
- The GPX content is first uploaded to your server at 'http://localhost:3001/api/gpx/upload'
- The XML content is parsed using xml2js to extract coordinate points
- Each coordinate point contains latitude and longitude information

3. Surface Detection:
- For each coordinate point, the map uses the `assignSurfacesViaNearest` function to determine the surface type
- The system moves the map view to each point's location
- It then queries nearby roads using Mapbox's queryRenderedFeatures API
- Surface types are classified as either 'paved' or 'unpaved' based on predefined arrays of surface descriptions
- The process shows a loading overlay with progress indication during this step

4. Route Visualization:
- After surface detection, the route is split into segments based on surface changes
- Each segment is styled differently:
  - White stroke base layer for visibility
  - Solid lines for paved segments (in orange '#e17055')
  - Dashed lines for unpaved segments (same color)
- Distance markers are added along the route at intervals based on the zoom level
- Photo markers are added if there are any photos near the route points

5. State Management:
- The route is added to the route store with:
  - A unique ID
  - The original GPX data
  - The file path
  - Color and visibility settings
- The system also maintains state for:
  - Current photos
  - Surface processing progress
  - Map readiness
  - Route name

6. Additional Features:
- The system includes clustering for photo markers
- Distance markers are dynamically updated based on zoom level
- The map automatically fits to show the entire route
- A loading overlay shows progress during surface detection

The key innovation in your system is the surface detection algorithm that tries to determine whether each segment is paved or unpaved based on nearby road data.

### MOVING PROCESSING TO DIGITAL OCEAN
I'll create a detailed migration plan to move your GPX processing to DigitalOcean.

Migration Plan:

1. Initial DigitalOcean Setup
- Create new project in DO
- Set up PostgreSQL with PostGIS
  - Create tables for routes, segments, surface data
  - Set up spatial indexes
- Set up Spaces bucket for file storage
- Set up App Platform for backend service

2. Backend Development
- Create Express/Node backend with endpoints:
  ```
  POST /gpx/upload - Initial file upload
  GET /gpx/status/:id - Check processing status
  GET /gpx/route/:id - Get processed route data
  ```
- Create processing services:
  - GPXParser service
  - SurfaceDetection service
  - RouteOptimizer service
  - Queue system for processing

3. Frontend Changes Needed
- Remove all GPX processing logic from MapContainer
- Remove surface detection code
- Modify upload flow:
  - Upload UI stays but becomes progress indicator
  - Add status checking
  - Modify route rendering to use server-processed data
- Update state management for processing status

4. Migration Steps

Step 1 - Setup Backend:
- Create initial DO backend service
- Set up database schema
- Create basic file upload endpoint
- Add basic route processing

Step 2 - Update Frontend Upload:
- Modify GpxUploader to use new endpoints
- Add upload progress indicator
- Remove client-side processing
- Test basic upload flow

Step 3 - Implement Processing:
- Add full GPX parsing on server
- Add surface detection using PostGIS
- Add route optimization
- Add status endpoints

Step 4 - Update Frontend Display:
- Modify route rendering
- Add processing status display
- Update state management
- Test full flow

Step 5 - Migration:
- Test with existing routes
- Add data migration script if needed
- Deploy backend
- Deploy frontend updates

Would you like me to expand on any of these steps before we start implementation?
