# Surface Detection Implementation Status

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Database Setup**
   - Successfully imported Australian OSM data into PostgreSQL
   - Created road_network table with surface information
   - Created surface_classifications table
   - Added spatial indexes for performance

2. **Surface Classifications**
   - Implemented standardized surface types:
     - asphalt
     - paved
     - unpaved
     - gravel
     - dirt
     - sand
     - grass
     - wood
     - fine_gravel
   - Surface count statistics in database:
     - unknown: 1,296,168 segments
     - asphalt: 748,249 segments
     - paved: 556,401 segments
     - unpaved: 270,773 segments
     - dirt: 38,917 segments
     - gravel: 34,687 segments
     - grass: 6,518 segments
     - sand: 6,505 segments
     - wood: 5,369 segments
     - fine_gravel: 3,704 segments

3. **API Implementation**
   - Added PostgreSQL connection to server.js
   - Implemented surface detection endpoints:
     - POST /api/surface-detection
     - POST /api/surface-detection/breakdown

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - Updated surface-detection.ts to use new API
   - Removed old client-side Mapbox detection
   - Successfully sending routes to API
   - Receiving surface data responses

## Current Issues

1. **Endpoint Duplication**
   - server.js has two identical PUT endpoints for '/api/maps/:id'
   - Both handlers implement update functionality
   - Need to remove one to avoid conflicts

2. **Surface Detection Query Issue**
   - Current query returns 0 for intersection_length and percentage
   - Root cause: Missing coordinate system transformations
   - Needs update to handle SRID transformations properly

## Next Steps Required

1. **Fix Server.js Duplication**
   - Remove duplicate PUT endpoint
   - Keep version using ObjectId for proper MongoDB ID handling

2. **Update PostgreSQL Query**
   - Add proper coordinate system transformations
   - Use geography type for accurate distance calculations
   - Add surface type grouping

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Add surface statistics logging
   - Consider caching frequent routes
   - Add error handling for edge cases

4. **Testing**
   - Test with various route types
   - Verify surface detection accuracy
   - Add performance monitoring

## Required Query Update

```sql
WITH route AS (
  SELECT ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON($1), 4326), 3857) as geom
)
SELECT 
  COALESCE(sc.standardized_surface, 'unknown') as surface_type,
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(ST_Intersection(ST_Transform(rn.geometry, 3857), route.geom), 4326)::geography) as intersection_length,
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(route.geom, 4326)::geography) as total_route_length,
  CASE 
    WHEN ST_Length(ST_Transform(route.geom, 4326)::geography) > 0 
    THEN (ST_Length(ST_Transform(ST_Intersection(ST_Transform(rn.geometry, 3857), route.geom), 4326)::geography) / 
          ST_Length(ST_Transform(route.geom, 4326)::geography) * 100)
    ELSE 0 
  END as percentage
FROM route
JOIN road_network rn ON ST_Intersects(ST_Transform(rn.geometry, 3857), route.geom)
LEFT JOIN surface_classifications sc ON rn.surface = sc.original_surface
WHERE ST_Intersects(ST_Transform(rn.geometry, 3857), route.geom)
GROUP BY sc.standardized_surface, route.geom
ORDER BY intersection_length DESC;
```





# GPX Upload and Processing Documentation

## Overview
We are migrating the GPX file processing from client-side to server-side using Digital Ocean. This will improve performance, reduce client workload, and enable more sophisticated processing capabilities. The main goals are:
1. Move file upload and processing to Digital Ocean
2. Implement server-side surface detection using PostGIS
3. Add efficient caching and optimization
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Completed Tasks

### Client-Side Structure
- ✅ Separated GPX processing logic from MapContainer
- ✅ Created GPX processing hook (useGpxProcessing)
- ✅ Created route rendering hook (useRouteRendering)
- ✅ Added cleanup for photo markers and event listeners
- ✅ Moved environment variables to .env.local
- ✅ Added proper error handling in client components
- ✅ Added progress indicators for processing
- ✅ Improved route data management

### API Structure

## Notes
- The server needs to handle large GPX files efficiently
- Surface detection should use PostGIS spatial queries
- All file operations should be asynchronous
- Processing should be queued for large files
- Add proper logging for debugging
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed operations
- Cache commonly accessed routes
- Add monitoring for server health
