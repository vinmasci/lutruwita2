# POI Layer Implementation Status

## Current Implementation âœ…
1. **Visual Structure**
   - Material Icons integration for POI symbols
   - Tooltip-style marker design with dark background and arrow pointer
   - Icon follows cursor during placement phase
   - Icons categorized into:
     - Infrastructure (Water Point, Toilets, etc.)
     - Services (Cafe, Restaurant, etc.)
     - Accommodation (Campground, Hotels, etc.)
     - Natural Features (Lookout, Beach, etc.)
     - Information (Visitor Center, Trail Head, etc.)

2. **User Interface**
   - Grid layout for icon selection
   - Modal-based interface for POI selection
   - Floating icon preview while placing
   - Name and description input fields

## Current Issues ðŸ”„
1. **Placement Workflow**
   - Icon selection works but placement is problematic
   - Escape key handling not functioning
   - Modal state management needs improvement
   - Cannot currently place POIs on map effectively

2. **Event Handling**
   - Click events not properly cleaned up
   - Event listener cleanup causing errors
   - Modal state and placement state not properly synchronized

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Event Handler Cleanup**
   - Properly implement click event handlers
   - Add proper cleanup for event listeners
   - Fix event propagation issues

2. **State Management**
   - Better coordinate modal state with placement state
   - Improve state transitions between selection and placement
   - Handle cancel/escape actions properly

3. **Position Handling**
   - Fix position tracking during placement
   - Ensure POIs are placed at correct coordinates
   - Implement proper coordinate transformation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Interaction Features**
   - Add POI editing capability
   - Implement POI deletion
   - Add POI click interactions
   - Consider POI information display on hover

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Implement save/load functionality for POIs
   - Add POI data to map save format
   - Consider POI categories in saved data

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Add POI filtering by category
   - Implement POI search functionality
   - Consider POI list view
   - Add category color coding

## Code Changes Required
1. Update event handler implementation in map-container.tsx
2. Fix state management in POIModal component
3. Improve position handling in handleAddPOI function
4. Add proper cleanup logic for event listeners
5. Implement Escape key handling
6. Fix modal state transitions

## Technical Notes
- Currently using Material Icons for POI symbols
- POIs are rendered using mapbox-gl markers
- State management handled through React useState
- Event handling through mapbox-gl events
- Position data stored in lat/lon format

## Known Bugs
1. POI placement not registering correctly
2. Escape key not canceling placement
3. Modal state sometimes out of sync
4. Event listeners not properly cleaned up
5. Position data sometimes incorrect

## Testing Required
1. Test POI placement workflow
2. Verify escape key functionality
3. Test modal state transitions
4. Verify position accuracy
5. Test event cleanup
6. Verify POI save/load functionality

## Dependencies
- Material Icons
- Mapbox GL JS
- React
- Material-UI components

Would you like me to help implement any of these fixes or explain any part in more detail?

# Debugging Session Status (2025-01-14)

## Fixed Issues
1. Map readiness issue resolved:
   - Map initialization sequence fixed
   - POI placement no longer affected by map loading state

## Current Issues
1. POI Placement still not working:
   - Click events are being detected but POIs aren't being placed
   - Added debugging logs to track the issue through the workflow:
     ```typescript
     // Map click detection
     // POI state management
     // POI Modal interaction
     // POI creation and placement
     ```

## Implementation Status
1. Data Structure Changes:
   - Fixed position data mismatch (lng/lon consistency)
   - Updated POI state interface to match required format
   - Corrected type handling between components

2. Event Handler Organization:
   - Removed nested useEffect
   - Properly structured event cleanup
   - Fixed cursor management using map instance

## Next Steps
1. Debug POI Placement Flow:
   - Monitor state changes during placement process
   - Verify data flow between components
   - Check POI creation and marker placement

2. Required Fixes:
   - Verify POI interface implementation
   - Test state updates in placement workflow
   - Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Validate marker creation and addition to map

3. Testing Needed:
   - Full POI placement workflow
   - Cancel functionality
   - Marker visibility and positioning
   - State cleanup on modal close

## Notes for Implementation
1. Added console logging at key points:
   - Map click event
   - POI state updates
   - Modal interactions
   - Marker placement

2. Areas to Monitor:
   - State synchronization between components
   - Event handler timing
   - Marker element creation
   - Map cursor management

3. Potential Issues to Check:
   - Modal state management
   - Event propagation
   - Position data conversion
   - Marker DOM element creation

Follow-up required to verify POI placement functionality after implementing debugging logs.
