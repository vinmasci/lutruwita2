# POI Layer Implementation Status - Updated

## Development History 📜

### Initial Approach (Deprecated)
The initial implementation attempted to:
- Use a floating icon that followed the cursor
- Handle complex state between modal and map components
- Manage multiple event listeners with manual cleanup
- Open the modal before placement
- Track cursor position continuously

### Second Attempt (Current)
Current implementation tried to simplify by:
- Using placement mode with crosshair cursor
- Creating temporary markers
- Opening modal after placement
- Managing state within map-container
- Using simpler event handling

### Current Issues
Despite improvements, several problems persist:
- State management remains complex within map-container
- Event cleanup is still problematic
- Modal and placement state synchronization issues
- Marker positioning inconsistencies
- Code maintainability challenges

## New Architecture Proposal 🏗️

### Component Structure
Moving POI functionality out of map-container into dedicated components:

```
src/
└── components/
    └── ui/
        └── map/
            ├── components/
            │   └── poi/
            │       ├── POIManager.tsx     # Main POI management component
            │       ├── POIModal.tsx       # Modal for POI details
            │       ├── POIMarker.tsx      # Individual POI marker
            │       └── POIToolbar.tsx     # POI selection interface
            └── utils/
                └── poi/
                    ├── poi-state.ts       # State management
                    ├── poi-events.ts      # Event handling
                    └── poi-markers.ts     # Marker utilities
```

### POIManager Component
Central component for POI management:
- Manages POI placement state
- Coordinates between toolbar and map
- Handles event delegation
- Controls modal visibility
- Manages marker lifecycle

### State Management
Clear separation of concerns:
1. Placement State
   ```typescript
   interface POIPlacementState {
     isPlacing: boolean;
     selectedType: POIType | null;
     temporaryMarker: Marker | null;
   }
   ```

2. POI Data State
   ```typescript
   interface POIState {
     pois: POIData[];
     selectedPOI: POIData | null;
     isModalOpen: boolean;
   }
   ```

### Event Flow
1. User selects POI type from toolbar
2. POIManager enters placement mode
3. User clicks map location
4. Temporary marker created
5. Modal opens for details
6. On save:
   - Temporary marker removed
   - Permanent POI created
   - State updated

### Interaction Model
1. Selection Phase
   - Click POI type in toolbar
   - Cursor changes to crosshair
   - Map click handlers activated

2. Placement Phase
   - Click on map
   - Temporary draggable marker appears
   - Position adjustable before confirmation

3. Configuration Phase
   - Modal opens with POI details form
   - Position finalized on save
   - Cleanup on cancel

## Implementation Plan 📋
